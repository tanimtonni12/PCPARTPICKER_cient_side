                <p className='font-semibold' >
                    To improve & optimize our React application, we must first find a performance problem in our application to fix. we have to use a constant Data Structure to make zero side effects. We should use the function component instead of the Class component. we have to optimize dependency. To avoid inline Function Definition in the Render Function. By avoiding Props in the Initial States. Spreading props on DOM elements. CSS Animations Instead of JS Animations.

                <h3 className='my-5 font-bold'> Q-2: What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?</h3>
                <p className='font-semibold'>
                    There are many types of states that we have to properly manage in our React application such as :
                    <li>Local state.</li>
                    <li>Global state.</li>
                    <li> Server state.</li>
                    <li> URL state.</li>
                </p>

                <h3 className='my-5 font-bold'> Q-3: How does prototypical inheritance work?</h3>
                <p className='font-semibold' >
                    The prototype is responsible for storing and giving access to a common set of methods and properties shared among all instances of the class or constructor to which the prototype is configured. In object, the prototype offers more flexibility than a class. It can be modified by adding new methods, as we saw early. Also, we can delete methods and even replace the prototype entirely with another object. So Prototypal inheritance is more than Class inheritance, by replacing the creation of objects, modification, and extension in an easy way using literal objects, with instances of classes, is like putting a constrained layer on top of the languageâ€™s flexibility.

                <h3 className='my-5 font-bold'> Q-4: What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</h3>
                <p >
                    Unit testing is a software development process or test where developer can do the test parts of an application or the smallest piece of code.  A unit can be a single function. The goal is to validate that each unit performs as it should. A unit test tests a behavior in isolation from other tests. If Unit has been done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages for developers.

                <h3 className='my-5 font-bold'> Q-5: You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?</h3>
                <p className='font-semibold'>
                    Answer: In react application, I will use rest API for searching to find products by id, name, price, description, etc and so I use the name of the specific product to find them. I will find it in rest API.

                <h3 className='my-5 font-bold'> Q-6: Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts </h3>
                <p className='font-semibold'>
                    Answer: React will then look at the virtual DOM, it also has a copy of the old virtual DOM, that is why we shouldn't update the state directly, so we can have two different object references in memory, we have the old virtual DOM as well as the new virtual DOM. setState, and React. useState create queues for React core to update the state object of a React component. So the process to update React state is asynchronous for performance reasons. That's why changes don't feel immediate.
